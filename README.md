# 🎭 Quiz Liberation Tool v1.0 
### _"Because sometimes quizzes need a revolution..."_
Crafted with chaos by SeedOfAnarky 🏴‍☠️

## 🌋 The Manifesto
Ever looked at a quiz system and thought, "This needs more... freedom"? Well, grab your Guy Fawkes mask and your favorite energy drink, because we're about to conduct some "alternative testing methodologies" on those pesky quiz limitations.

## 🎯 Core Arsenal

### 🔓 The Liberator Suite
- **Mod - QuizButton1**: Your first taste of freedom
- **Mod - QuizButton2**: Because one revolution wasn't enough
- **Radio Button Liberation Front**: Setting those radio buttons free since 2024

### 🧠 Advanced Insurgency Features
```javascript
// They said it couldn't be done...
const completionMessage = document.querySelector(".sensei-message.tick");
if (completionMessage && completionMessage.includes("Congratulations!")) {
    // Smoke bomb deployed 💨
}
```

## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Chrome Browser (our trojan horse of choice)
- Developer Mode enabled (because we're "developers" 😏)
- A healthy disrespect for unnecessary limitations

### The Ritual
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeedOfAnarky/quiz-liberation.git
cd quiz-liberation
# Welcome to the resistance
```
